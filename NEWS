0.1-2	(under development)
  o	add support for Hadoop 2.x which uses semi-globs in
	hadoop classpath

  o	Hadoop detection has been streamlined to match other packages
	like iotools/hmr. First, Hadoop home is detected using
	HADOOP_HOME or HADOOP_PREFIX (in that order) environment
	variables. If `bin/hadoop` is not detected in the home, then
	`hadoop` command is located via PATH and if unsuccessful then
	`/usr/lib/hadoop/bin/hadoop` is tried. In addition,
	HADOOP_CLASSPATH can be set as a last-resort fall-back.


0.1-1	2014-07-29
  o	added HDFS file-like operations such as hdfs.glob(), hdfs.info(),
	hdfs.exists(), hdfs.home(), hdfs.rename(), hdfs.unlink() and
	hdfs.mkdir()


0.1-0	2013-05-01
  o	initial release supporting HDFS read connections
